# DOCKER
Docker is a platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and manage applications in lightweight containers. These containers package an application and all its dependencies, ensuring consistent 
performance across different environments. Docker uses images as templates for containers, which can be easily shared via Docker Hub. This technology simplifies development, enhances scalability, and
helps avoid compatibility issues,making it a popular choice for modern software development and deployment.

Key features of Docker include:

1. **Containerization**: Applications run in isolated environments, which makes them portable and easy to manage.

2. **Images and Dockerfile**: Docker uses images as blueprints for containers. A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions to build an image.

3. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry where users can share and distribute Docker images.

4. **Orchestration**: Tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes can manage multi-container applications and services.

Overall, Docker streamlines development workflows, improves resource utilization, and enhances application deployment speed.

# CONTAINERS

Containers are lightweight, portable units that package an application and all its dependencies, including libraries, configuration files, and runtime. They run in isolation from one another on the same operating system kernel, which makes them more efficient than traditional virtual machines.

Key characteristics of containers include:

1. **Isolation**: Each container operates independently, ensuring that applications do not interfere with each other.
2. **Portability**: Containers can run consistently across different environments, from a developer's laptop to production servers.
3. **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead and improving resource utilization compared to virtual machines.
4. **Scalability**: Containers can be easily scaled up or down to handle varying workloads.

Overall, containers facilitate rapid development, testing, and deployment of applications, making them a cornerstone of modern DevOps practices.
