# DOCKER
Docker is a platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and manage applications in lightweight containers. These containers package an application and all its dependencies, ensuring consistent 
performance across different environments. Docker uses images as templates for containers, which can be easily shared via Docker Hub. This technology simplifies development, enhances scalability, and
helps avoid compatibility issues,making it a popular choice for modern software development and deployment.

Key features of Docker include:

1. **Containerization**: Applications run in isolated environments, which makes them portable and easy to manage.

2. **Images and Dockerfile**: Docker uses images as blueprints for containers. A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions to build an image.

3. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry where users can share and distribute Docker images.

4. **Orchestration**: Tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes can manage multi-container applications and services.

Overall, Docker streamlines development workflows, improves resource utilization, and enhances application deployment speed.
